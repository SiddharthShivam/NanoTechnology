                Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in both developed and developing nations,
                with coronary heart disease being the primary contributor to its incidence and fatalities.
                Atherosclerosis, characterized by the narrowing and obstruction of blood vessels, leading to
                reduced blood flow and heart muscle ischemia, is the most common cause of coronary heart
                disease. Other CVD conditions include arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial
                disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary
                embolism, all stem from irregular heart function and associated structures. The primary reason
                behind these health issues is a sedentary lifestyle marked by a lack of physical activity, widely
                recognized as the main contributor to CVD in humans. Additionally, the lockdowns and remote
                work arrangements have reduced physical activity, exacerbating this sedentary lifestyle. Nonetheless,
                there are various measures available to prevent and treat CVDs, such as engaging in regular exercise
                and physical activity to mitigate these conditions. Other factors that contribute to CVDs include
                smoking, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels. Nanotechnology has the potential to play a vital role
                in the early detection and treatment of these conditions.
                Nanomaterials offer the potential to accomplish therapeutic tasks that are challenging to
                achieve using conventional biomaterials. Over the past twenty years, various types of
                nanotechnologies for biomedical applications have emerged, each possessing unique
                characteristics and advantages.
                Innovative nano-drug carriers, introduced into the bloodstream, can be designed to be
                selectively taken up by immune cells. These carriers aim to modulate inflammatory processes
                and travel to the plaque deposits in the arteries to deliver therapeutic payloads.
                Nanoparticles have been extensively employed in laboratory studies to track the development of
                atherosclerosis and inflammation through fluorescence technologies. For instance, the
                utilization of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles has expanded our knowledge of the post-heart
                attack tissue remodeling and the involvement of inflammatory monocytes. While these
                nanoparticle-based imaging techniques have greatly enhanced our understanding in preclinical
                research, their application to clinical patient populations is currently limited.
                Beyond their therapeutic application, nanoparticles can be loaded with small molecules,
                chelated ions, metals, or nanocrystals to facilitate their detection through diagnostic imaging.
                Nanomedicine is expected to play a significant role in managing cardiovascular diseases in
                general, and atherosclerosis in particular. Since many heart conditions are linked to elevated
                cholesterol levels, especially a high LDL to HDL ratio, nanotechnology can be employed to
                mimic the structure and function of HDL using nanoscale liposomes. These artificial HDL-like
                carriers can help remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transport it to the liver for
                elimination, thereby reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.
                Current treatments for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) primarily focus on restoring
                normal blood flow through damaged blood vessels and preventing further cardiovascular issues.
                Statin therapy is effective in reducing the thickness and subsequent buildup of atherosclerotic
                plaques, impacting the integrity of arterial walls and dense calcium deposits.
                For CVD prevention, dual antiplatelet therapy is often the first line of defense, using
                medications like aspirin and clopidogrel, which inhibit clot formation and platelet
                aggregation. However, there's a pressing need for improvement in these therapies,
                particularly due to the significant side effects associated with antiplatelet drugs and
                patient adherence issues [28]. Additionally, some patients do not respond well to
                antiplatelet medications, which negatively affects their long-term prognosis. Research
                has shown that individuals who have experienced a heart attack but do not respond
                adequately to clopidogrel are at a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events during
                follow-up. This highlights the importance of technological advancements and the
                potential of nanomedicine.

            <p class="section-content">
                Regular Stents vs Nano Particle Stents
                The introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures, starting with balloon
                angioplasty and evolving into intravascular stenting, has brought relief to millions of individuals
                with coronary artery disease. Two successful intravascular stent types, bare-metal stents (BMS)
                and drug-eluting stents (DES), have transformed interventional cardiology. While BMS can
                restore blocked arteries and support the regrowth of the artery's inner lining, it has a drawback
                with nearly 30% of cases experiencing in-stent restenosis. This restenosis is primarily caused by
                the migration and excessive growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the stent in
                response to the injury caused by stent deployment.
                DES, the current clinical standard, has evolved from BMS and incorporates drugs that reduce
                VSMC overgrowth within the stent, thereby lowering restenosis rates. However, DES introduced
                a new challenge in the form of late and very late stent thrombosis in the long term. The
                antiproliferative effect of DES slows down the process of re-growing the inner lining of the
                vessel, which triggers platelet activation and leads to stent thrombosis. Although stent
                thrombosis is relatively rare, it can manifest suddenly with severe, life-threatening symptoms
                and high mortality. Additionally, the polymeric coatings used for drug delivery can lead to
                inflammatory reactions and other stability issues, further complicating matters. The development
                of DES has advanced through multiple generations.
                First-generation DES featured a stainless steel stent coated with either sirolimus or paclitaxel.
                Observations of late stent thrombosis and the presence of inflammatory cells around the stent
                struts have highlighted polymer hypersensitivity as a significant concern. Second-generation
                drug-eluting stents (DES) introduced cobalt-chromium stents coated with more biocompatible
                polymers like phosphorylcholine and a copolymer of poly(vinylidene
                fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), which helped reduce inflammation. These stents feature
                thinner struts, increased flexibility, better deliverability, enhanced biocompatibility, and superior
                regrowth of the inner vessel lining, and they have become the most commonly used clinical
                stents.
                In an effort to further minimize the inflammatory response, third-generation DES employ entirely
                bioabsorbable polymers such as poly-lactic acid (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and
                polycaprolactone (PCL).
                Researchers are actively working to advance stent technology and develop a new stent material
                or surface that can both promote the regrowth of the inner vessel lining and prevent restenosis,
                all while maintaining the stent's compatibility with blood and its essential characteristics. To
                achieve this goal, various innovative approaches have been proposed and tested at the
                laboratory level and preclinically in animal models, with a few progressing to clinical trials.
                One of these innovative approaches focuses on engineering the surface of stents to introduce
                changes in their topography, chemistry, roughness, and wettability. Additionally, these modified
                surfaces can serve as a platform for loading drugs or biologics, making them an important area
                of development in coronary stent technology. Ensuring the long-term safety and compatibility of
                stents with the body's biology and blood is a crucial factor, demanding careful selection of stent
                materials, design, and surface properties.
                Stent surface engineering involves altering the surface of stent materials to enhance their
                overall performance. This can be achieved through chemical modifications or by applying thin
                films with desired properties to the existing surface. This helps prevent corrosion, ion leaching,
                enhances biocompatibility, and improves interactions between cells and the stent material.
                Nanosurface engineering takes this a step further by working at the nanoscale, where at least
                one dimension of the features is less than 100 nm. This small scale allows for the manipulation
                of surface properties like roughness, reactivity, and wettability, which, when employed through
                nanostructures, can lead to stents with improved biological performance [38,39]. It's important
                that these surface modifications do not significantly affect the mechanical characteristics of
                stents, such as their deliverability, crimping and expansion profiles, and coating durability.
                Advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to precisely control surface properties at the
                nanoscale, impacting factors like material choice and drug incorporation.
                From a materials engineering perspective, the physical and chemical properties of a
                biomaterial's surface, including its topography, chemistry, and hydrophilicity, have a profound
                influence on cellular processes. Additionally, the size and shape of these structures can regulate
                cellular functions by altering cytoskeleton organization.
                Recent advancements represent a significant shift towards utilizing nanoengineered coatings on
                stents to enhance their effectiveness. These innovations encompass methods that involve
                modifying stents without the use of polymers, controlled drug delivery coatings, drug-free
                nanoscale approaches, and stents coated with nanoparticles or nanofibers. Stents with
                nanofiber coatings, created through electrospinning, are considered a part of nanotechnology
                since the diameters of the electrospun fibers are at the nanoscale, although they may not strictly
                fall under the category of "surface engineering.” There's a substantial body of literature
                exploring various nanotechnology-based techniques aimed at creating nanoscale surface
                features and coatings on existing stent materials. These nanoengineered stents address common
                issues such as restenosis, insufficient re-growth of the inner vessel lining, local inflammation, and
                the formation of blood clots, which are challenges associated with bare-metal stents (BMS) and
                drug-eluting stents (DES). The next generation of cardiovascular stents is expected to heavily
                incorporate nanotechnology due to the numerous benefits it offers. However, despite these
                advantages, the widespread clinical adoption of stents utilizing this technology in the biomedical
                device industry is still pending.
                Stents with surface modification at the nanoscale in clinical trials.
